# Intelligent Network Security System 

## Description
A machine learning–based Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) that classifies
network traffic as normal or anomalous using supervised learning algorithms.

## Dataset
- KDD Cup 99 (Kaggle)
- 41 network traffic features

## Models Used
KNN, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, GBM, XGBoost,
LightGBM, CatBoost, AdaBoost, Naive Bayes, Voting Classifier

## Preprocessing
- Label Encoding
- Standard Scaling
- Feature Selection using RFE
- Train-Test Split (80/20)

## Results
Ensemble models such as Random Forest, LightGBM, and Voting Classifier
achieved over 99% test accuracy.

## Tools
Python, Jupyter Notebook, Scikit-learn, NumPy.
